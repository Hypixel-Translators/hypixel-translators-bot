# Translation [![Crowdin](https://badges.crowdin.net/hypixel-translators-bot/localized.svg)](https://crowdin.com/project/hypixel-translators-bot)
The bot has a `+language` command which allows you to change your language when using it. You can also help translate it to your language! We currently support all languages on the Hypixel project to the bot, plus some other ones requested by the community. If your language isn't supported yet, please let us know and we will work on implementing it.

## Want to help?
To join the translation project, please make a join request [here](https://crowdin.com/project/hypixel-translators-bot) and include your Discord tag (QkeleQ10#6046 for example) or your Discord ID. If you don't include either of these you will be denied, even if we know who you are. This is so that we can give you access to the special channel made to discuss bot translations (#bot-translators).

## Just want to check it out?
In order to change your language, execute `+language <language>`. If you find any bugs, please let us know by adding an issue [here](https://github.com/QkeleQ10/hypixel-translators-bot-discord/issues). Keep in mind you do not have to join the translation project in order to use the language, but it may not be fully translated.
